Responsiveness issues
	toolbar too wide, modal too high
Static image rotation for non-animatable sketches
	Use to speed up rotation slider
Hide rotation for circular sketches
Ability to animate image parameters
Video sizing
	Pad vs extend
Download picture sizing

Existing Sketches
-----------------
Phyllotaxis
	Add note to spread
	Primes
	Fill background with spokes?
	Ways to choose an angle: Continued fractions?
	Mirrored angular colour transitions
	Fade hue through black or white
	Improve performance with images (prerender filters, pre-resize if no growth)
	Alternative petal shapes:
		Curves
		Polygon: join adjacent points
		Recursive: cauliflower
	Clipping bug when aspectRatio > 1 && petalStretch > aspectRatio

Sierpinski Carpet
	Lopsidedness


New Sketches
------------
Copy machine
	Change to stack based implementation

Parser Failures
---------------
2cos(0)^2
|t^3|
ending in whitespace
x(2) should only be interpreted as a function if it is a function
(a+b)sin(x)
(a+b)(c+d)
