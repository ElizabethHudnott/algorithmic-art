* Force preview animation mode (when not for a video) if excessive computation time used.
Bug signature background doesn't follow background image
Bug: dragging position slider doesn't leave background permanently transitioned
Bug: Can't drag underneath modals, etc.
Bug: lose drag selection when dragging outside the window
Bug: Handle WebGL context lost while generating video.
Bug: blur doesn't work on still image export
Bug: scale mode doesn't work with webgl
Bug: SVG selection box doesn't rotate when the canvas is rotated
Bug: outstanding changes flagged after aborting video rendering
Bug: initial floating window positions
Bug: resizing window while video rendering messes up scale parameter
Bug: need to load & save loop + full rotation options as part of the document
Finish dark mode
Performance: remove transparency & shadow when dragging sliders (including playback slider)?
Bug: WebGL canvas not resizing (needs different field of view)

Contours
	Displace distribution graph
	Presets
	Drag points

Phyllotaxis
	Option to draw the spiral line
