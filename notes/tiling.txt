Terminology
	Edge matching puzzle

Basic Parameters
	Cell width
	Cell height

Anchor points:
	Corners
	Middle of edges
	1/3 and 2/3 along each edge*
	* Notional positions that can be adjusted to any symmetric formation, e.g. 1/4 and 3/4

3 or 4 lines meeting at the corners of several tiles
	Use probabilities to decide whether to use 1, 2, 3 or 4 colours (flow / don't flow)

"A or B" style connections
	E.g. For Tile Set 7 it should be able to connect a semicircle with just one quarter circle

Colours
	A chosen number of basic colours (1-16 plus background colour)
	Colour varies along the length of a line
		Fixed hue (except when fading between hues at a t-junction)
		Saturation or brightness or opacity varies between chosen minimum and maximum value (or no variation at all)
	VGA / retro style default palette

Tile 18 (cross)
	Fill central circle with a random desaturated rainbow colour?

Tile Sets
	No.	Reference	Shape	Filled
	0	Corners 	Line 	No
	1	Corners 	Curve 	No
	2	Middles		Line 	No
	3	Middles		Curve 	No
	4	Corners 	Line 	Yes*
	5	Corners 	Curve 	Yes*
	6	Middles		Line 	Yes+
	7	Middles		Curve 	Yes+
	* The anchor points are actually the mid-points
	+ The anchor points are actually the 1/3 and 2/3 points

Choose a selection of tiles
	Can be from multiple different tile sets
	Assign a probability of being chosen to each one.

Tile Sets Variants
	Draw / Don't draw path outlines
	Round off the ends of lines by drawing into a neighbouring cell (or don't)

Filled Tile Sets
	Background colour flows like the other colours (or isn't used at all)
	But no two colours can be the same

Tsuro tiles
	8 anchor points (1/3 and 2/3 along each edge)
	Anchor points joined in pairs

Custom tileset
	Uploaded from a multiple graphics files

Tile Selection Order
	Outwards from the centre of the screen (so that it zooms from the centre)

Tile Patterns
	Fully random
	Recursive
	Specific pattern expressed by a code
		Numbers and (lower case) letters: select which kind of tile (base 36)
		Random tile type: R (capital)
		Blank tile: space
		Pattern separator: |
	Randomly generated pattern code

Modes of pattern codeword interpretation (in addition to fully random option)
	Repeat X, Repeat Y
		Begin with the first pattern.
		Repeat the pattern horizontally.
		Switch to the next pattern when beginning a new row.
		Once every pattern has bee used then return to the first one.
	Repeat X, Permutate Y
		Begin with a random pattern.
		Repeat the pattern horizontally.
		Switch to a different random pattern when beginning a new row until each pattern has been used once.
		Once every pattern has been used then choose a random pattern, different to the last row rendered so far.
		Keep selecting different patterns until every pattern has been twice.
		Keep repeating the procedure.
	Random But Use Patterns
		No repetition left-to-right. Just keep choosing different patterns and fill the screen, left to right, top to bottom.
		If a pattern doesn't fully fit onto a row then wrap it onto the beginning of the next row.
		When we begin a new row and a new pattern at the same time then start from a random offset within the pattern, not necessarily the first tile in the pattern.

Modifications to the Mode of repetition
	Probabilities for mutation. Two types:
		Probability of mutating into a rotated or flipped version of the tile in the pattern.
		Probability of mutating into any other type of tile, randomly selected.
	Symmetry enforcement. Two values (for left & right and top & bottom), each one of:
		No symmetry
		Reflective symmetry
		Rotational symmetry (twofold, or fourfold if both are set)

Mouse Interactions
	Click to change tiles. Two modes.
		1 Click to stamp the selected tile type.
		2 Click to rotate.

Above & left, right and below placement conditions
	Only used in fully random mode
	Based on whether the other tile has an output at a particular anchor point
	May sometimes return true when a condition is not satisfied (randomness)
	Condition checking can be enabled or disabled on a per tile type basis
	permittedTiling(above, right, below, left)
		Arguments are tile types or special values for when a tile hasn't been placed yet (undefined) or if the position is off screen (fake tile has everything is connected)

Special Renderings
	Randomize curve control points per tile
	Drop shadow
	Draw faint grid lines (grey level parameter)
	Stone effect
	3D effect
		Alternating columns: thin and dark lines, thick and light
	Increased line width in lower rows

Animations
	Colour flowing along the "pipes"

	Sliding
		Direction parameter (in degrees)
		Translate the direction into x and y movements
			E.g. (3, 1) means move the pattern 3 cell positions to the right and then 1 position down.
			At least one of the movements is always a 0 or a 1.
		Divide the screen up into groups of columns and groups of rows of a chosen width and height (in cells)
		Randomly choose an x-offset and a y-offset
			E.g. 6 columns with a screen 30 cells wide and an x-offset of 1 means that when we slide up or down we slide column numbers 1, 7, 13,...
			Change the offsets a specified number of times during the animation.

	Control points of curves flexing (oscillating back and forth)
		can draw outside of the cell

	Gradually rotating one or more tiles (chequerboard selection)
		0 Raise tile (3D effect, increase shadow)
		1 Rotate
		2 Place tile down
		3 Make minimum changes to the colours so that still flow properly
			Quickly fade colour through black or white (nearest).

	Building outwards from a single tile

	Mutations by one or more simultaneous random walks
		0 Start at a random point
		1 Change the tile to a new tile type
		2 Move to a new tile
			Prefer to move out of the current cell in the direction of a line
			Prefer to move into a neighbouring cell if it has a line exiting into the current cell

	Maze traversal
		Filling in the background coloured parts with another colour

Remapped Spaces
	Curves going out from the centre to the edge of a circle and curves perpendicular to them (Clock 52)

Tile Shapes
	Rectangular
	Chevrons
	Brick wall pattern?
	Triangular
	Hexagonal (serpentiles)

Tile designer UI

More systematic tile numberings (than currently in the folders)
	Covers most (not all) tile designs

	Tile Sets 2 & 3
		Each edge of the cell has 2 potential edges
			A line from the middle of the edge to the centre
			A line from the middle of that edge to the middle of the next edge
		Each potential edge is assigned one of eight values
			0	No line drawn
			1-8	The index of the colour used to draw the line
		8 digit decimal code plus 4 additional bits (1 hexadecimal digit) to indicate if edges of the second kind are straight or curved

	Tile Set 4
		4 digit code.
		Each digit signifies the colour of one triangle.

	Tile Set 6
		Similar / same as sets 2 & 3.
		8 decimal digits plus one hexadecimal one.
		Each of the 8 digits signifies the colour of one half of a quadrant (triangle).

	Tile Set 7
		8 decimal digit code
		One shape digit per quadrant
			0	Rectangle or continuation of half ellipse
			1	Quarter circle facing inwards
			2	Quarter circle facing outwards
		One colour digit per quadrant (0-4)
			Areas not covered by a shape described above are drawn in Colour 0
