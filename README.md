# Mathematical Art with Elizabeth

This project is a collection of computer art sketches which draw simple geometric figures on the screen which become starting points for creating multitudes of interesting variations, each with their own individual flare. The user adjusts parameters to create something which uniquely visually appeals to them. The finished art piece is an image or a video that combines JavaScript programming, the chosen choice of parameter settings, and in some cases pseudorandom aspects.

The web app currently includes the following sketches.

* One-Dimensional celluar automata
* Circle packing
* Contour plotting
* Graphing calculator
* Julia & Mandelbrot sets
* Phyllotaxis (spirals)
* Sierpinski carpet fractal
* Trigonometry swirls
* Tiling
* Spirograph

More sketches will be added later.

The project includes a UI and a common framework that sketches share in order to access animation facilities and other features. Sketches can use either Canvas 2D or a WebGL fragment shader for rendering.

The project aims to engage with people who are interested in abstract art, mathematical curiosities or sensory stimulation.
