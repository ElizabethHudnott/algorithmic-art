		<span class="sketch-title">Truchet Tiles</span> show how the simplest of rules can create intricate patterns when applied over and over. Only a small number of design motifs are used to create the picture. The screen is divided into a grid of cells. Each cell contains a simple shape that is randomly selected from a library of designs which you edit from within the program. Some cells may be left entirely blank. The resulting pattern looks like a maze of twisted pipework reminiscent of the 1989 game Pipe Mania.

	The specific rules activated enforced depend on the kind of tile but may include, for example, ensuring that a t-junction or cross shaped tile connects to at least one horizontally adjacent tile and another tile above or below itself.

<div id="tiles-grid-row-pattern">
	Applies changes to the directionality and angles of the chevrons or parallelograms on a per row basis. Use <kbd>+</kbd> to make them point one way or <kbd>-</kbd> to point the other way or <kbd>0</kbd> for rectangular tiles. Enter as many symbols as you like, one after another. You can also use <kbd>+1</kbd>, for example, to have a row with ¹⁄₁₀th of the effect's intensity.

<div id="tiles-grid-col-pattern">
	Applies changes to the directionality and angles of the chevrons or parallelograms on a per column basis. Use <kbd>+</kbd> to make them point one way or <kbd>-</kbd> to point the other way or <kbd>0</kbd> for rectangular tiles. Enter as many symbols as you like, one after another. You can also use <kbd>+1</kbd>, for example, to have a column with ¹⁄₁₀th of the effect's intensity.
