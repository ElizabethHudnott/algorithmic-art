Carpet: stretch does nothing when drawing area is square (use screen aspect ratio instead)
Carpet: bipartite with images: colour background
Carpet: bipartite is not bipartite when middle width and middle height are both 0

Environment
-----------
Service Worker
Separate video "save" from download

Bug: fading background image to color & color to image?
Bug: outstanding changes flagged after aborting video rendering
Bug: Clicking position slider ignored while playing
Bug: initial floating window positions
Bug: resizing window while video rendering
Link from spirograph page
Bug: WebGL canvas not resizing (needs different field of view)

User created sketches
	documentation: template download link, GitHub, util functions
	online editor
Responsiveness issues
	toolbar too wide
	turning iPad from landscape to portrait loses modal partially off to the right
Static image rotation for non-animatable sketches
	Use to speed up rotation slider
Ability to animate image parameters
Video sizing
	Pad vs extend
Download picture sizing & format
Ability to animate sketches that use random numbers
Gallery
	Share to: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest, DeviantArt?
Ability to incorporate video data
	as component image and as background

Existing Sketches
-----------------
Phyllotaxis
	Option to draw the spiral line
	Primes
	Fill background with spokes?
	Mirrored angular colour transitions
	Improve performance with images (prerender filters, pre-resize if no growth)
	Alternative petal shapes:
		Curves
		Polygon: join adjacent points
		Recursive: cauliflower
	Clipping bug when aspectRatio > 1 && petalStretch > aspectRatio

Calculator
	Object groupings
	User-defined variables (at piece, path, shape, object and global scopes)
	Text
	Polygons (not necessarily regular)
	Fourier series

Cellular Automata
	Number base selection for preset: 10 or numStates
	Seed to be expressed in base numStates
	Born, survive, decay specification
	Rule table compression: reflection, map permutations of colors to the same/different values
	Brick wall neighbourhoods (odd left, even right)
	Alternate neighbourhoods

Julia Set
	Possible functions
		z = c * z * (1-z)


New Sketches
------------
Copy machine
	Change to stack based implementation

Parser Failures
---------------
2cos(0)^2
|t^3|
x'
ending in whitespace
x(2) should only be interpreted as a function if it is a function
(a+b)sin(x)
(a+b)(c+d)
3 * -sin(t)
cos(t)sin(t)
