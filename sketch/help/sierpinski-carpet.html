		<span class="sketch-title">Sierpinski's Carpet</span> works with the idea of taking a big shape, removing a smaller shape from it using a cookie cutter, rinse and repeat. It starts by dividing up a large rectangle that covers the entire drawing area into nine smaller rectangular areas arranged in a 3&times;3 grid. The middle rectangle is painted in a colour (black by default). Then every one of the other eight smaller rectangles get painted in a second colour (white by default) and then the entire process is repeated inside each of the eight smaller rectangles, treating each one like the large rectangle we started with. You can see each step of the process by locating the depth control on the Geometry tab of the parameters window and reducing the depth down to one. The result is a single black rectangle. When you increase the depth to two then eight smaller black rectangles appear.
	</p>

	<p>
		The process so far is:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Paint the middle portion black.
		</li>
		<li>
			Paint each of the remaining eight portions white.
		</li>
		<li>
			Paint a small black rectangle inside the middle portion of each of those eight portions.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		So far we have:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			One background colour (white).
		</li>
		<li>
			One filling colour (black).
		</li>
		<li>
			No opacity (translucency). No whiteness shows through the black.
		</li>
		<li>
			No blending effects like paint programs like Photoshop have.
		</li>
		<li>
			The centre "filling" is just a black rectangle. We could draw something more elaborate instead.
		</li>
		<li>
			The nine sections are all the same size.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are nine sections, as opposed to seven or five.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		All of these things can be changed however.

<div id="carpet-fill-block">
	This option paints a plain rectangle (black by default) in the spaces marked out by the virtual cookie cutter.
</div>

<div id="carpet-fill-image">
	This option paints copies of an image of your choice in the spaces marked out by the virtual cookie cutter. It's an alternative option instead of having black rectangles.
</div>

<div id="carpet-fill-concentric">
	This option paints concentric bands of colour in the spaces marked out by the virtual cookie cutter. It's an alternative option instead of having black rectangles.
</div>

<div id="carpet-patterned-centre">
	<p>
		The centre of the image is decorated or distinguished in some way when this box is ticked and is plainer or less decorated when the box is not ticked. The precise manner in which it's decorated depends on how some other options are set. The primary filling may be applied to the corners, mid-sections or both.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="carpet-pattern-loc-corner">
	Selecting this option will apply the chosen pattern to the four corner locations out of the nine total locations which exist by default at level&nbsp;1 (and 4&times;8 corner locations out of 9&times;8 total locations at level&nbsp;2, etc.). The four locations positioned halfway between two corners will be drawn with a simple block filling.
</div>

<div id="carpet-pattern-loc-middle">
	Selecting this option will apply the chosen pattern to the four locations which are positioned halfway between two corner locations, that is four locations out of the nine total locations which exist by default at level&nbsp;1 (and 4&times;8 mid-point locations out of 9&times;8 total locations at level&nbsp;2, etc.). The four corner locations will be drawn with a simple block filling.
</div>

<div id="carpet-pattern-loc-both">
	When this option is selected the chosen pattern will be applied as the filling in every possible location. From the nine locations that exist by default in each grid, no location will consistently have a simple rectangular block filling. However, the filling for the centre of the whole image (level&nbsp;0) can be controlled separately using the "Patterned centre" tick box. The pattern depth control also has an impact.
</div>

<div id="carpet-pattern-depth">
	This controls how many levels of detail have the chosen pattern applied to them. If there are more levels of detail drawn in total than the number of levels with a pattern then the finest levels of detail will be drawn using a simple rectangular block filling. The total number of levels of detail can be changed using a control located under the Geometry tab.
</div>

<div id="carpet-concentric-density">
	This is roughly equal to the maximum number of rectangles (or rather rectangle approximations) contained within a collection of concentric rectangle approximations in a location filled with the pattern.
</div>

<div id="carpet-relative-spacing">
	This makes the coloured bands thicker and the transparent bands simultaneously thinner, or the coloured bands thinner and the transparent bands thicker.
</div>

<div id="carpet-tlx-corner">
	This controls how far the top-left corner of a coloured band sticks out towards the centre of the shape.
</div>

<div id="carpet-tly-corner">
	This controls the angle of the top edge of each band.
</div>

<div id="carpet-ll-corner">
	This controls the position of the bottom-left corner of each band as well as the angles of the left edge and the bottom edge. Move the slider further to the left to push the corner outward or move the slider to the right to move the corner closer to the centre.
</div>

<div id="carpet-lr-corner">
	This controls the thickness of the bottom part of each coloured band.
</div>

<div id="carpet-colors">
	Here you can choose colours for the nine sections of the 3&times;3 grid. These are applied recursively. For example, if red is chosen as the top-left colour then the top-left section of the overall image is painted red (⅑th portion). But a smaller piece, the top-left corner within the top-left corner is painted with a second layer of red paint. Use the sliders underneath each colour to change how thick each layer of paint is. You can make a colour translucent like watercolour or opaque.
</div>

<div id="carpet-emphasis">
	This controls how many levels of detail are drawn opaquely without any translucency effect applied to the filling. The opacity slider for the central portion will be ignored initially and translucency will only be applied at the finer levels of detail. This option will have no effect if the centre opacity slider is positioned fully to the right, which is the default position.
</div>

<div id="carpet-blend-depth">
	This controls how many times rectangles are painted with colour. No background painting is performed at level 1. When set to 2 then the 8 large outer rectangles (default number) have their backgrounds painted once but when the finer details are added only their centre rectangles are painted. When set to 3 then 8 large rectangles are painted followed by 8&times;8 smaller rectangles, and everywhere except the very centre ends up being painted twice. You can build up layered effects using opacities and blend modes.
</div>

<div id="carpet-blend-filling">
	This selects whether or not the blend mode chosen above is applied to the filling (centre rectangle) in addition to being applied to the background areas. If this box is unticked then the filling will be painted in source over mode regardless of which blend mode is selected above. Most blend modes look even better when they're applied to everything (this box ticked) but sometimes a particular blend mode can badly distort the filling, in which case unticking this box improves the image. Alternatively, just experiment and use it as an extra option to play with.
</div>

<div id="carpet-depth">
	This is number of levels of detail to draw. At level&nbsp;1 only a single rectangle is drawn. At level&nbsp;2 the centre rectangle is surrounded by 4&ndash;8 rectangles that are each one size smaller. At level 3 each those 4&ndash;8 rectangles is surrounded by 4&ndash;8 rectangles that are smaller still, and so on.
</div>

<div id="carpet-overlap">
	This enlarges each centre rectangle so that it partially obscures the rectangles surrounding it.
</div>

<div id="carpet-cutouts">
	These tick boxes let you choose at which corners the overlap is drawn (extending into blank space, ticked state) and where the overlap is trimmed, creating a non-rectangular shape (unticked state). To see any effect you'll need to set both a non-zero amount of overlap and have one or more of the eight outer tick boxes from the group on the left unticked.
</div>

<div id="carpet-cutout-depth">
	When this is &gt;1 the effect of the cut-out tick boxes (above) is turned off for some parts of the image. At low numbered levels of detail (largest shapes) the effect is as if none of the tick boxes were ticked, while for finer details cut-outs are applied according to the settings selected above.
</div>

<div id="carpet-lopsidedness-x">
	Moving this slider to the right makes the left column bigger and right column smaller. Conversely, moving the slider towards the left makes the left column narrower and the right column wider. To make both columns wider or both columns narrower use the Stretch slider instead.
</div>

<div id="carpet-lopsidedness-y">
	Moving this slider to the right makes the top row bigger and bottom row smaller. Conversely, moving the slider to the left makes the top row shorter and the bottom row taller.
</div>

<div id="carpet-middle-width">
	This slider makes the middle column wider or narrower.
</div>

<div id="carpet-middle-height">
	This slider makes the middle row taller or shorter.
</div>

<div id="carpet-size">
	This slider reduces the overall size of the image. This is useful for creating animations.
</div>

<div id="carpet-stretch">
	This slider makes the overall image wider or narrower. The rectangular sections become more elongated or more square.
</div>

<div id="carpet-left">
	If there's empty space in the horizontal direction (i.e. if the Stretch parameter is below maximum) then this controls the distribution of empty space between the left side of the screen and the right side.
</div>

<div id="carpet-top">
	If there's empty space in the vertical direction (i.e. if the Size parameter is below maximum) then this controls the distribution of empty space between the top and bottom.
</div>

<div id="carpet-rotation">
	Rotates the image. Use the button on the right to return to the initial setting. This rotates around the centre of the area where content is drawn. Depending on the values of other parameters like Left and Top this might have an effect different from using the rotation slider in the layers window.
</div>
