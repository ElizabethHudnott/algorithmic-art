	<h6>Iterated Functions</h6>
	<p>
	Consider the equation <var>y</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+ <var>c</var> for some constant called <var>c</var>. But now <var>y</var> becomes the next value of <var>x</var> and the next value in a sequence of numbers described by the equation <var>x<sub>n+1</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>x<sub>n</sub></var><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+ <var>c</var>. If we let <var>x<sub>0</sub></var> equal 2 and <var>c</var> equal 0 then we get the sequence 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536&hellip; Each number is the square of one before it and the numbers grow larger and larger. But if <var>x<sub>0</sub></var> is ½ then we get the sequence ½, ¼, ¹⁄₁₆, ¹⁄₂₅₆, ¹⁄₆₅₅₃₆&hellip; Now the numbers shrink down towards zero. And if <var>x<sub>0</sub></var> is 1 then we get the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1&hellip;

	<h6>Complex Numbers</h6>
	<p>
		Do you know what the square root of -1 is? If we stick to using the ordinary <em>real numbers</em> then there isn't one. A positive number multiplied by itself will always be equal to another positive number and multiplying a negative number by itself will also result in a positive number. There is no real number that produces a negative number when you square it and thus the square root of -1 has no solution. But that's okay because a mathematician is happy to simply <em>imagine</em> that a solution exists and give it the name i. The <dfn>imaginary numbers</dfn> are multiples of this imaginary solution to the square root of minus one. For example 3i is three times the imaginary solution to square root of minus one. A <dfn>complex number</dfn> is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number, for example 2&nbsp;+ 3i. This sounds pretty silly but it turns out that complex numbers can be used to solve practical engineering problems and produce beautiful art.

	<h6>Computing a Julia Set</h6>
	<p>
		Now let's look at <var>z<sub>n+1</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>z<sub>n</sub></var><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+ <var>c</var> but this time let's permit complex numbers for <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> and <var>c</var>. If you picture a ruler with the real numbers written on it then just as we can picture the real numbers arranged in a line we can also arrange the complex numbers geometrically but the result isn't a line but a plane. As well as moving left or right by increasing or decreasing the real number part we can also move up and down by increasing and decreasing how many multiples of the square root of minus one we have. Now we can take any position on the computer screen and describe its location using a complex number of the form <var>x</var>&nbsp;+ <var>y</var>i. For each pixel on the screen we use our formula <var>z<sub>n+1</sub></var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>z<sub>n</sub></var><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+ <var>c</var> to generate a sequence of complex numbers starting from <var>z<sub>0</sub></var>&nbsp;= <var>x</var>&nbsp;+ <var>y</var>i. We use different values for <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> depending on the pixel but we use a fixed value for <var>c</var>. If the sequence of numbers grows larger and larger then we choose a colour for the pixel based on how quickly the numbers start growing big. If the sequence never produces big numbers, for example if the numbers shrink down towards 0&nbsp;+ 0i, then we give that pixel a fixed colour. I've left these pixels transparent. You can experiment with a variety of different formulas for calculating <var>z<sub>n+1</sub></var>.

	<h6>Mandelbrot Set</h6>
	<p>
		We can produce a second image from the same equation. Instead of fixing <var>c</var> and varying <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> depending on the pixel location we can do the opposite and vary <var>c</var> but fix <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> at 0&nbsp;+ 0i. This produces an image called the Mandelbrot Set.
	</p>

	<h6>Traps</h6>
	<p>
		I mentioned that for every point on the screen the sketch analyzes the sequence <var>z<sub>0</sub></var>, <var>z<sub>1</sub></var>, <var>z<sub>2</sub></var>, <var>z<sub>3</sub></var>&hellip; and chooses a colour based on how quickly the numbers grow. But more complicated colouring schemes are also possible. <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> is our point on the screen. Because the other values in the sequence are also complex numbers they too can be interpreted geometrically as points although you won't see any visualization of them on screen. All we see is that the pixel at the location corresponding to <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> becomes coloured in some particular colour whose selection depends upon some kind of analysis of the whole sequence. But now instead of using how quickly the numbers grow to choose a colour let's do something different. Let's define a reference point. I'll call it <var>P</var>. Now, for each value in the sequence we can calculate the distance between <var>z<sub>n</sub></var> and <var>P</var> and colour our pixel based upon the minimum such distance. Geometrically this corresponds to making a hidden journey starting from <var>z<sub>0</sub></var> and moving onto <var>z<sub>1</sub></var>, from there to <var>z<sub>2</sub></var>, and so on and finally selecting a pixel colour based on how close that pixel's journey managed to get to <var>P</var>. Visually the overall picture looks like concentric circles, bubbles, spheres or insect body segments.

	<h6>Inspiration</h6>
	<p>
		This sketch was inspired by Daniel Shiffman's <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/021-mandelbrot-p5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coding Challenge #21</a> and <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/022-juliaset.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coding Challenge #22</a> and by gazing in a trance into computer screens in the 90s watching a program called ChaosPro by  Martin Pfingstl draw Julia sets line by line on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3DJF7MbMU&start=407" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commodore Amiga computer</a>, taking several minutes to draw a 320&times;256 image. A newer version of ChaosPro is available for Windows computers (<a href="http://www.chaospro.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Current website</a>).
