Phyllotaxis: remove slider for fixed opacity
Carpet: bipartite with images: colour background
Carpet: bipartite is not bipartite when middle width and middle height are both 0

	documentation: template download link, GitHub, util functions
	online editor
Responsiveness issues
	toolbar too wide
	turning iPad from landscape to portrait loses modal partially off to the right
Static image rotation for non-animatable sketches
	Use to speed up rotation slider
Ability to animate image parameters
Video sizing
	Pad vs extend
Download picture sizing & format
Ability to animate sketches that use random numbers
Aspect ratio when rotating: height squared, as is, hypotenuse square

Existing Sketches
-----------------
Phyllotaxis
	Option to draw the spiral line
	Primes
	Fill background with spokes?
	Mirrored angular colour transitions
	Improve performance with images (prerender filters, pre-resize if no growth)
	Alternative petal shapes:
		Curves
		Polygon: join adjacent points
		Recursive: cauliflower
	Clipping bug when aspectRatio > 1 && petalStretch > aspectRatio

Calculator
	Object groupings
	User-defined variables (at piece, path, shape, object and global scopes)
	Text
	Polygons (not necessarily regular)
	Fourier series

Cellular Automata
	Number base selection for preset: 10 or numStates
	Seed to be expressed in base numStates
	Born, survive, decay specification
	Rule table compression: reflection, map permutations of colors to the same/different values
	Brick wall neighbourhoods (odd left, even right)
	Alternate neighbourhoods

Julia Set
	Possible functions
		z = c * z * (1-z)


New Sketches
------------
Copy machine
	Change to stack based implementation

Parser Failures
---------------
2cos(0)^2
|t^3|
x'
ending in whitespace
x(2) should only be interpreted as a function if it is a function
(a+b)sin(x)
(a+b)(c+d)
3 * -sin(t)
cos(t)sin(t)
