Bug: background images with destination-over
Bug: Handle WebGL context lost while generating video.
Bug: blur doesn't work on still image export
Bug: scale mode doesn't work with webgl
Bug: SVG selection box doesn't rotate when the canvas is rotated
Bug: outstanding changes flagged after aborting video rendering
Bug: initial floating window positions
Bug: resizing window while video rendering messes up scale parameter
Bug: need to load & save loop + full rotation options as part of the document
Finish dark mode
Don't make thumbnails lazy loading when visible on start-up
Performance: remove transparency & shadow when dragging sliders (including playback slider)?
Bug: WebGL canvas not resizing (needs different field of view)

Existing Sketches
-----------------
Phyllotaxis
	Option to draw the spiral line
	Primes
	Fill background with spokes?
	Mirrored angular colour transitions
	Improve performance with images (prerender filters, pre-resize if no growth)
	Alternative petal shapes:
		Curves
		Polygon: join adjacent points
		Recursive: cauliflower
	Bug: shadows being clipped
	Clipping bug when aspectRatio > 1 && petalStretch > aspectRatio

Calculator
	Object groupings
	User-defined variables (at piece, path, shape, object and global scopes)
	Text
	Polygons (not necessarily regular)
	Fourier series

Cellular Automata
	Number base selection for preset: 10 or numStates
	Seed to be expressed in base numStates
	Born, survive, decay specification
	Rule table compression: reflection, map permutations of colors to the same/different values
	Brick wall neighbourhoods (odd left, even right)
	Alternate neighbourhoods

Julia Set
	Possible functions
		z = c * z * (1-z)


New Sketches
------------
Copy machine
	Change to stack based implementation
