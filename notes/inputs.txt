Inputs
	Data files
		MIDI
		CSV
			optional headings
			optional time indices (first column)
			min and max values for each column (clip output below/above these values)

	Devices
		MIDI devices
			key presses, CCs RPNs, NRPNs, program changes, pitch bend
		computer keyboard
		mouse movement and buttons
		gamepads
		dance mats
		hand gestures (webcam/Kinect)
		microphone
			clapping? whistling?
		touchscreen
		accelerometer

	Key presses
		Single key or a chord
			On a specific bank-program number combination
				Program number + bank number * 128
		Trigger all matching rules if they modify different parameters
		When two rules modify the same parameter then ones involving more keys take precedence over ones with fewer keys
			Rules with same number of keys: one higher up in the list takes precedence
		Key/button press modes:
			Press-hold-release with velocity
			Press-hold-release without velocity

Parameter changes
	"min" value when the key combination is released /  CC set to 0
		"min" value is the same as the starting frame value
	"max" value when the key is pressed with maximum velocity / CC set to 127
		can optionally ignore velocity information and always use the maximum
		"max" can be numerically less than "min" => upside down envelope

	Envelope parameters are configured as part of the input set up on a per program basis but can be changed using particular CC messages (as per General MIDI Level 2)

	attack-hold-release (both linear) for integer parameters
	ADSR (exponential attack, decay & release) for float parameters

Parameter data types
	boolean
		can be inverted with respect to key down state
	string
		has a key press value and a key release value
	integer
	float
	RGBA colour
	arrays
		modifies a subarray
		starting index to modify
		"min" and "max" values are arrays
		pad with zeros, false or black if an array needs to be extended

Table of keypresses
	Sketch offers a number of named events
	Input config maps a range of notes to an event name and event parameter value
	Sketch can read a bank-program number combination's envelope parameters

	Table
		Bank-program number combination
		Event name
		Parameter value
		Note number relative to the lowest in the range
		Velocity
		Time struck
		Time released
	Same note can appear more than once if struck in quick succession (causes immediate release)
	Sketch deletes entries when they are no longer needed
