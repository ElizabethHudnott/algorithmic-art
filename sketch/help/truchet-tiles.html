		<span class="sketch-title">Truchet Tiles</span> shows how the simplest of rules can create intricate patterns when repeated over and over. There are only a small number of design motifs used to create the picture. The screen is divided into a grid of cells. Each cell contains either an upward stroke from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner of the cell, or a downward stroke from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner. Some cells may be left entirely blank. The resulting pattern looks a bit like a maze.
