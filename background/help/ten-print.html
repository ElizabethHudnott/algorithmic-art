		<span class="sketch-title">10 PRINT</span> shows how the simplest of rules can create intricate patterns when repeated over and over. There only two design motifs in this sketch. The screen is divided into a grid of rectangular cells. Each cell contains either an upward stroke from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner of the cell, or a downward stroke from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner. Some cells may be left entirely blank. The resulting pattern looks a bit like a maze.
