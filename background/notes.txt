Environment
-----------
Bug: WebGL canvas not resizing (needs different field of view)
Bug: Clicking settings button should unminimize window.
Bug: Moving position slider while playing is considered to have changes
Add full screen toggle button?
Save As button
Bug: changing startFrame, endFrame or tweenData while rendering video
Handle attempting to download non-existent files (e.g. wrong generator name)
Link from home page
Add credits
Add URL to signature
User created sketches
	documentation: template download link, GitHub, util functions
	online editor
Responsiveness issues
	toolbar too wide, modal too high
Static image rotation for non-animatable sketches
	Use to speed up rotation slider
Ability to animate image parameters
Video sizing
	Pad vs extend
Download picture sizing
Ability to animate sketches that use random numbers
Aspect ratio when rotating: height squared, as is, hypotenuse square
Gallery
	Share to: Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Pinterest, DeviantArt?
Ability to incorporate video data
	as component image and as background
Radial blur
Background: color, picture, video or layered sketches
Animation easing
	XY properties should pass through the endFrame point at the halfway point in the animation
WebGL shader sketches
Progressive Web App

Existing Sketches
-----------------
Phyllotaxis
	Randomize option (within a range) for H/S/L/A
	Option to draw the spiral line
	Add note to spread
	Primes
	Fill background with spokes?
	Ways to choose an angle: Continued fractions?
	Mirrored angular colour transitions
	Fade hue through black or white
	Improve performance with images (prerender filters, pre-resize if no growth)
	Alternative petal shapes:
		Curves
		Polygon: join adjacent points
		Recursive: cauliflower
	Clipping bug when aspectRatio > 1 && petalStretch > aspectRatio

Calculator
	Object groupings
	User-defined variables (at piece, path, shape, object and global scopes)
	Text
	Polygons (not necessarily regular)
	Fourier series

Cellular Automata
	Number base selection for preset: 10 or numStates
	Seed to be expressed in base numStates
	Born, survive, decay specification
	Rule table compression: reflection, map permutations of colors to the same/different values
	Brick wall neighbourhoods (odd left, even right)
	Alternate neighbourhoods

Julia Set
	Possible functions
		Divisions of polynomials
		z = c*sin(z)
		z = ci * cos(z)
		z = c * exp(z);
		z = c * z * (1-z)


New Sketches
------------
Copy machine
	Change to stack based implementation

Parser Failures
---------------
2cos(0)^2
|t^3|
x'
ending in whitespace
x(2) should only be interpreted as a function if it is a function
(a+b)sin(x)
(a+b)(c+d)
3 * -sin(t)
cos(t)sin(t)
