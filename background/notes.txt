User created sketches
	documentation: template download link, GitHub, util functions
	online editor
Generalize left and top parameters
Responsiveness issues
	toolbar too wide, modal too high
Static image rotation for non-animatable sketches
	Use to speed up rotation slider
Ability to animate image parameters
Video sizing
	Pad vs extend
Download picture sizing
Ability to animate sketches that use random numbers
Aspect ratio when rotating: height squared, as is, hypotenuse square
Gallery
Ability to incorporate video data
	as component image and as background

WebGL shader sketches

Existing Sketches
-----------------
Phyllotaxis
	Add note to spread
	Primes
	Fill background with spokes?
	Ways to choose an angle: Continued fractions?
	Mirrored angular colour transitions
	Fade hue through black or white
	Improve performance with images (prerender filters, pre-resize if no growth)
	Alternative petal shapes:
		Curves
		Polygon: join adjacent points
		Recursive: cauliflower
	Clipping bug when aspectRatio > 1 && petalStretch > aspectRatio

Calculator
	User-defined variables

Cellular Automata
	Number base selection for preset: 10 or numStates
	Seed to be expressed in base numStates
	Born, survive, decay specification
	Rule table compression: reflection, map permutations of colors to the same/different values
	Brick wall neighbourhoods (odd left, even right)
	Alternate neighbourhoods

New Sketches
------------
Copy machine
	Change to stack based implementation

Parser Failures
