		<span class="sketch-title">Truchet Tiles</span> show how the simplest of rules can create intricate patterns when applied over and over. Only a small number of design motifs are used to create the picture. The screen is divided into a grid of cells. Each cell contains a simple shape that is randomly selected from a library of designs that you can edit from within the program. Some cells may be left entirely blank. The resulting pattern looks like a maze of twisted pipework reminiscent of the 1989 game Pipe Mania.
